      <em>April 2023</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      On a warm day in Brooklyn, a small community will often gather on Fourth
      Avenue and 24th Street. The size of the group changes, but you can
      regularly find at least three people sitting in the short overhang of a
      shuttered deli entrance. People play music, dominoes, and Instagram Reels.
      A regular visitor named José explained to me the merits of spending “no
      more than an hour on the same street everyday to be sure you know what’s
      going on”. Sometimes, everyone locates around a short turn of the block,
      dodging the sun in the heat and seeking it out in early spring. Watching
      videos throughout the day, sharing social media posts, or otherwise simply
      socializing, José and others hang out as the busy avenue rumbles past.
      <br /><br />
      They do this in close proximity to a LinkNYC kiosk. The kiosks, housed in
      sleek technological boxes, provide free WiFi, phone-calling, and other
      modern services at no cost. Rolled out in 2015, the digital nodes replaced
      the city’s aging public payphone system with a remarkable set of
      communication tools. New Yorkers have observed their deployment with a mix
      of excitement, anxiety, and fury–it seems no one in the city has forgotten
      the unfortunate reporting of individuals watching pornography in early
      2016 on their built-in tablets. Despite this infatuation with the unsavory
      side of the system, few have a complete understanding of what the kiosks
      really are, how they are used, or where they are mostly located.

      At its best, the LinkNYC kiosks are one component of a large public WiFi
      system that fills in some gaps in broadband access around the city. Public
      WiFi supports millions of New Yorkers while targeting those without the
      funds at home or the physical infrastructure in their neighborhoods to get
      high speed WiFi access. Termed the “digital divide”, it is evident that
      access to modern communication infrastructure at an affordable cost is
      highest in wealthier, whiter, and more centrally-located neighborhoods. We
      know from collective recent experience how important broadband access is
      for everything from child education to public health, and much data
      suggests that the most vulnerable and marginalized New Yorkers bear the
      brunt of the real impact of a lack of digital connectivity.
      <br /><br />
      LinkNYC, as one of the thirteen providers of public WiFi in the city, is
      the end product of a remarkable effort to tackle this issue. A coalition
      of technologists, entrepreneurs, government, and advocacy stakeholders
      designed the system as an intervention in the digital divide. They created
      a vision for an innovative private-public partnership that provides
      streetside services in this new and changing field of contemporary
      telecommunications. The system today that developed from their efforts
      operates across all five boroughs, permitting both stationary users and
      on-the-go WiFi seekers to connect to the internet in many of the city’s
      neighborhoods. Lots of other things are enabled by LinkNYC, too: free
      telephone calls, USB charging, and a variety of other features on its
      built-in tablet including a nearest bathroom finder. Perhaps as varied as
      the city itself, users of the LinkNYC kiosks are utilizing these services
      in dramatically different ways. On one block, a group of teenagers hangs
      out while one of them charges their phone. On another block, neighbors
      linger as they call home, wherever in that world that may be, both on the
      built-in phone and through their internet-connected personal devices. And
      on other streets we can often see the kiosks standing unused, weird blobs
      futuristically broadcasting WiFi for all. I guess these kiosks simply
      observe the city go by.

      The kiosks are always observing. At its worst, the LinkNYC kiosks are an
      unequal product in our city that collect significant amounts of data about
      our whereabouts and online activities. The rollout of the kiosks has
      targeted the busy districts of the urban core, where most residents not
      only already have access to high speed broadband at home but have
      relatively high median household incomes. Neighborhoods such as Mott Haven
      and Parkchester in the Bronx or Borough Park and Brownsville in
      Brooklyn–areas with low access to broadband at reasonable rates with
      low-income, marginalized communities–are entirely left out of the LinkNYC
      program at the time of this writing. What’s more, users agree to a
      legalistic privacy statement when first connecting their phones to the
      WiFi or when opening up a session on the built-in tablets. The privacy
      statement includes agreeing to having your device location, URL
      clickstream, and MAC plus IP addresses recorded by LinkNYC for their use.
      The services also require an email to connect on your device, a clear
      barrier to entry for many who do not have an email or do not wish to
      provide it. Intersection, the company that owns and operates the kiosks,
      stores all this data in anonymized formats before using it to sell
      advertisements on the built-in kiosk display screens. Surprised? You
      shouldn’t be—Intersection’s parent company, Alphabet, has been excelling
      at this model of targeted advertising for over a decade now with its most
      famous product: GoogleAds.

      In the frenetic heart of Times Square, a LinkNYC kiosk features a lot of
      diverse urban use.

    <p>
      The kiosks are additionally equipped with three video cameras, including
      one that users can activate to make video calls. Intersection has, in the
      past, published video surveillance taken from their 9 foot-high security
      cameras, openly acknowledging their full cooperation with law enforcement
      in sharing their footage. They have, however, noted that the cameras are
      “usually turned off”, although many activists have questioned why the
      kiosks would be equipped with cameras at all if this were the case.
      Between the data collection measures, the ability to survey the street,
      and the business model based on advertisement revenue, the kiosks
      represent an entirely new way of providing services that could be
      categorized as a surveillant capitalist model. This will definitely sound
      blasphemous, but we can perhaps understand the uniqueness of this model by
      imagining a public school that required we collect information
      (anonymized, of course!) on students that we then used to sell ads in
      order to fund their education. Sounds a little funky, no?

      Despite the tangible drawbacks to the LinkNYC model, it is evident that
      the system is highly utilized by a wide variety of users in contemporary
      New York. In what follows, I share in more detail my observations of the
      incredible diversity of usages of four specific LinkNYC kiosks across the
      city. What’s more, it remains a darling of the Adams administration, who
      has even expanded the program dramatically by crafting a new division
      known as Link5G that aims to use much larger kiosks to house 5G
      technology. The next moves for Intersection involve a much-more stringent
      requirement to locate 90% of their new kiosks outside of Manhattan below
      96th Street–a move Dr. Bola Omotosho, chair of Bronx Community Board 5,
      has described as the “best innovation of the 21st century”. While this
      expansion is outside of the scope of this paper, it is noteworthy to
      understand the continued significance of not only the history that led to
      the system we have today but its current usage in 2023 as policymakers
      move to expand it.

      Over the past six months I’ve observed four specific LinkNYC kiosks,
      documenting the activities and opinions of their users, and recording the
      streetlife around these locations. I spent time with the small community
      at Fourth Avenue and 24th Street and frequented a busy site on Lawrence
      Street in Fulton Mall. I jammed my way into Times Square, documenting the
      activity at a rambunctious kiosk on W 45th Street. And I’ve observed a
      LinkNYC on W 123rd Street in Harlem, a shining metallic box that is barely
      used. My process has involved arriving at a site and investing fifteen
      minutes in observing, discussing, and debating the kiosks with anyone
      willing to talk to me. I have done this with a sense of urgency and,
      bizarrely, even a feeling of anxiety. It feels like the moment to act is
      now, but it also feels unclear what the acting is on. What feels clearest
      is the need to share and discuss where public WiFi is going, and why,
      before we have closed the door on how it will be deployed.
      <br /><br />
      I am convinced that what we have today is an example of New Yorkers making
      lemonade out of lemons. Across the city, a system that raises questions
      around privacy, surveillance, and equity is being used in spectacular
      spatial, social, and entrepreneurial ways. From the perspective of an
      urban planner, the activities of LinkNYC users have suggested deeply
      impactful spatial design interventions that could affect a totally new and
      unique node in urban life. What follows is a spatial walkthrough of each
      of my four sites accompanied by a series of some of the design
      interventions I am proposing based on my research. This is my highly
      opinionated, minorly quantitative, and deeply qualitative set of
      guidelines for how we can facilitate this urban design challenge–I look
      forward to hearing yours.
