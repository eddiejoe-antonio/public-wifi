        <h2>object qualities</h2>
        <p class="pros__cons">+ Big fans of charging port  <br>
            + Some people liked the transit displays<br>
            + Almost every site featured a lot of leaning, propping, and other usages of the kiosk for support<br>
            + Lots of people liked to use the tool for video watching<br>
            + Lots of people make phone calls, both local and international (one person said he only called his doctor from a LinkNYC phone, never his cell phone)
        </p>
        <p class="pros__cons">- Inability to print anything!<br>
            - Challenging to type on<br>
            - Charging port time VERY contentious in certain places, and bizarrely usually between people who know each other<br>
            - Challenging to understand privacy policy. Many people were surprised to hear about the data collection and unsure what that even meant<br>
            - Relative ignorance of being connected to the WiFi, especially for car drivers<br>
            - Serious concern over video surveillance, particularly with Spanish speakers<br>
            - Negative reputation and distrust of using WiFi in certain areas<br>
            - Clustering of things around kiosk results in an accessibility issue<br>
            - Neighbor animosity towards loud music playing and loitering<br>
            - Relatively hit or miss servicing of the tablets. In 50 visits, I identified 18 malfunctioning kiosk tablets<br>
            - Serious opposition from street vendors and business owners, especially in Times Square, citing kiosks attracting types of people that drive business away<br>

        <h2>takeaways: public wifi on the street</h2>
        <p class="pros__cons">
            + Ease of accessibility <br>
            + Globalized system of telecommunication <br>
            + Public charging function <br>
        </p>
        <p class="pros__cons">
            - Relative overdemand of resources in certain areas (especially for charging)<br>
            - Lack of productive capabilities like printing and typing<br>
            - Mismatch of streetside locations to land use/economic activities<br>
            - Concern over ability of system to surveil users<br>
            - Challenging to understand privacy policy, when and where users are on the network, and other mechanics of the system<br>

    <h2>takeaways: public wifi, more broadly</h2>
    <p class="takeaways" style="line-height: 10vh; font-size: 5vh;">
        <em>Public WiFi</em> Locations should interpret land use and economic patterns in their vicinity to locate more strategically
        <em>Public WiFi</em> solutions should include the robust telecommunications capacities of LinkNYC, especially the ability to communicate with other countries
        <em>Public WiFi</em> solutions need shade, heated, and cooled spaces
        <em>Public WiFi</em> solutions should include the ability to charge devices on the go, like in the current kiosks
        <em>Public WiFi</em> solutions should be spatially distributed according to the needs of the city and not related to the former locations of payphones
        <em>Public WiFi</em> solutions need to better communication their ability to surveil users and collect data, and otherwise better explain their business models
